# ESP8266-Thermostat

This wifi thermostat allows you to set the optimal temperature in your home thoughout the week via smartphone and then, 
when it's cold enough, singals the healer via a 433 Mhz signal to turn on. When the temperature rises more than 0.5 degrees above
the target, it turns the heater off.

The main prerequisite is to capture the 433 Mhz signals from the original thermostat, to find out which signal turns the heater on and off.
