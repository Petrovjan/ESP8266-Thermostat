# ESP8266-Thermostat

This wifi thermostat allows you to set the optimal temperature in your home thoughout the week via smartphone or a browser. When the actual temperature drops below the target temperature, the thermostat sends a 433 Mhz signal to the heater and turns it on. When the temperature rises more than 0.5 degrees above the target, it turns the heater off.

The only prerequisite is to capture the 433 Mhz signals from the original thermostat, to find out which signals turn the heater on and off.
